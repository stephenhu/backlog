# backlog

a scrum backlog generator written in ruby.  parses source file comments for
TODO keywords and normalizes this data to a file, database, or other backend,
this backend is then presented via a web interface.

as a developer, sometimes it's just easier to concentrate inside of an editor
rather than switch from editor to project management tool.  adding TODO
comments is simple and non-intrusive.
